## Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails
1. Check Java version: `java --version`
2. Check Maven path: `mvn --version`
3. Clean and retry: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`

### If App Won't Start
1. Check port 8080 is free: `netstat -an | findstr :8080`
2. Check H2 database permissions
3. Verify Gmail credentials in `application-dev.yml`

### If Email Polling Stops
1. Watch for error messages with ‚ùå emoji
2. Check Gmail app password validity
3. Monitor timing - cycles should happen every 2 minutes
4. Look for "Next email polling cycle will start" messages
