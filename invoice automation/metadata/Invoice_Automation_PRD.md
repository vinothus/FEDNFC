# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Invoice Automation

## Project Overview

### Project Title
Invoice Automation System

### Project Description
This project involves developing an automated system for processing PDF invoices received via email. The system will extract data using OCR technology and store the processed information in a database with generated URLs for easy access.

### Objectives
- Automate the extraction and storage of invoice data from emailed PDFs.
- Provide secure, role-based access to invoice data via a web interface.
- Generate accessible URLs for invoice PDFs with proper access controls.

### Stakeholders
- Clients: End-users managing invoices.
- Administrators: Manage user access and system configurations.
- Developers: Build and maintain the system.

## Scope

### In Scope
- OCR processing for invoice PDFs.
- Database storage for invoices and generated URLs.
- Hierarchical access controls (e.g., admin, manager, user roles).
- Web application integration for invoice management.
- Backend API for invoice processing and data handling.

### Out of Scope
- Email server setup for receiving invoices (assume integration with existing email services).
- Advanced analytics or reporting beyond basic CRUD operations.
- Integration with third-party accounting software.

## Features

### Feature: Invoice Automation

#### Description
Automate processing of PDF invoices received via email, extract data using OCR, store in database, and generate accessible URLs.

#### Sub-Features
1. **Invoice Ingestion**
   - Monitor a designated location (e.g., email inbox or folder) for new PDF invoices.
   - Automatically save PDFs to local file system and store as BLOBs in database.

2. **OCR Processing**
   - Extract text from digital PDFs using Java libraries (Apache Tika, iText).
   - Extract text from scanned PDFs using OCR libraries (Tesseract4J).
   - Parse and extract key data (e.g., invoice number, date, amount, vendor, items).
   - Validate extracted data for accuracy.

3. **Data Storage**
   - Store extracted data in a client-specific database table.
   - Store PDF files as BLOBs in database with file path references for local storage.

4. **Web Application Integration**
   - View and search invoices.
   - Access PDFs via database retrieval with access controls.

#### Backend API
- Endpoints for uploading/processing invoices, retrieving invoice data, and PDF file access.

## Functional Requirements

### User Roles and Permissions
- **Admin**: Full access, manage users and hierarchies.
- **Manager**: Access to department-level invoices.
- **User**: View invoices based on assigned permissions.

### Web App Requirements
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers.
- Frameworks: React.js or similar for frontend.
- Features: Dashboards for invoices, search/filter, forms for data entry.

### Backend Requirements
- API: RESTful or GraphQL.
- Database: Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data.
- Authentication: JWT or OAuth for secure access.
- OCR Library: Java-based OCR libraries (Apache Tika, Tesseract4J, or iText for PDF text extraction).
- Storage: Local file system with database BLOB storage for PDF files.

### Integration Points
- Email integration (e.g., IMAP for fetching attachments).

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- API response time < 2 seconds.
- OCR processing < 10 seconds per invoice.
- Support up to 1000 concurrent users.

### Security
- Data encryption in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Compliance: GDPR for data privacy.

### Scalability
- Server-based deployment with load balancing.
- Horizontal scaling through multiple application instances.

### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime.
- Automated backups and error logging.

### Usability
- Intuitive UI/UX.
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1).

## Technical Stack (Suggested)
- **Web Frontend**: React.js with Redux.
- **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot (alternatively, Node.js/Express or Python/Django).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for production, H2 for development.
- **OCR/PDF Processing**: Apache Tika, iText 7, Tesseract4J for Java-based text extraction.
- **File Storage**: Local file system with database BLOB storage.
- **Other**: CI/CD with GitHub Actions, traditional server deployment.

## Assumptions and Dependencies
- Availability of Java OCR libraries and PDF processing libraries.
- Client provides sample PDFs for testing.
- Access to email systems for invoice ingestion.
- Sufficient local storage capacity for PDF file archival.
- Database capacity for BLOB storage of PDF files.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: OCR accuracy. **Mitigation**: Implement validation and manual override.
- **Risk**: Data security. **Mitigation**: Regular audits and encryption.
- **Risk**: Email integration complexity. **Mitigation**: Use established email APIs and libraries.
- **Risk**: PDF text extraction accuracy. **Mitigation**: Combine multiple Java libraries and implement fallback mechanisms.

## Timeline and Milestones (High-Level)
- Phase 1: Requirements and Design (2 weeks).
- Phase 2: Backend Development and OCR Integration (4 weeks).
- Phase 3: Web Interface Development (3 weeks).
- Phase 4: Email Integration (2 weeks).
- Phase 5: Testing and Validation (3 weeks).
